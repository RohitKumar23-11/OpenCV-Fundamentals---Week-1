## 🔧 Introduction to OpenCV

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. Initially developed by Intel, it supports real-time vision applications and is now widely used in research and industry.

**Setup & Installation**

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

---

## 🧠 Core Functionality (core module)

The `core` module handles:

* Basic data types (`cv::Mat`, `cv::Point`, etc.)
* Matrix arithmetic and operations
* Random number generation
* Timing utilities
* Array manipulations

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Scalar arithmetic
* Image masking and pixel access
* Matrix operations

---

## 🖼️ Image Processing (imgproc module)

This module includes:

* Image transformations (resize, rotate)
* Filtering (blur, Gaussian, bilateral)
* Edge detection (Canny)
* Geometric operations (morphology, contours)
* Histogram equalization

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Resize and rotate images
* Apply filters (median, blur, Gaussian)
* Detect edges and contours

---

## 🧩 Application Utils (highgui, imgcodecs, videoio)

Useful for interaction with images and video:

* Display windows (`cv2.imshow`)
* Read/write images and videos
* Capture from cameras or video files

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Load and display images (`dog.png`)
* Capture frames from webcam
* Save processed images

---

## 📷 Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction (calib3d)

Provides:

* Camera model definition and calibration
* Lens distortion removal
* Stereo vision
* Pose estimation (PnP, epipolar geometry)

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Undistort an image using known camera parameters
* Estimate object pose from 2D-3D points
* Stereo image matching (disparity maps)

---

## 👀 Object Detection (objdetect module)

Includes pre-trained object detectors:

* Haar cascades for face, eyes, pedestrians, etc.
* QR code detector

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Face detection using Haar cascade
* QR code detection and decoding

🗂️ *Note*: Custom cascades (e.g., `dog_data.xml`) must be trained separately.

---

## ⭐ 2D Features Framework (feature2d module)

Handles feature-based computer vision:

* Keypoint detectors: Harris, Shi-Tomasi, FAST
* Descriptors: ORB, BRISK, SIFT, AKAZE
* Feature matching with FLANN or brute-force

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Detect and visualize keypoints
* Match features between images

🔍 *Used for*: Object tracking, panorama stitching, image alignment

---

## 🧠 Deep Neural Networks (dnn module)

Integrates deep learning models into OpenCV:

* Load pre-trained models (e.g., Caffe, TensorFlow, ONNX)
* Run inference on images or video
* Classify objects and detect objects

📁 **Code Examples**:

* Load GoogLeNet or MobileNet
* Run classification on `dog.png`
* Show top-5 predictions with confidence

---

## 📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV across its full range of capabilities—from basic image handling to advanced deep learning and 3D reconstruction. It's intended as a hands-on reference for developers and students exploring computer vision with Python.
